  directory = blockr_option("topline_dir", system.file("extdata", "examples", package =
    "artful")),
  ...
)

\arguments{
\item{file}{File name (in \code{\link[base:basename]{base::basename()}} sense)}

\item{directory}{Directory where \code{file} is located}

\description{
This block reads and parses an RTF file into a \code{data.frame} object. The
function aims to return a copy of the original RTF table with as little data
preprocessing performed as possible (i.e., only essential steps such as
removing headers, footers, empty columns, etc., are performed). Unlike
\code{new_rtf_block()}, this function does not attempt to produce an ARD. Instead,
this step is off-loaded to other functions.

\examples{
\dontrun{
blockr.core::serve(new_rtf_to_df_block(file = "rt-ae-ae1.rtf"))
}
